                            <p id="9.2">Key things to remember is when first starting off your SMEAC briefing, give the layout and description of the AO, maybe include a map depending on how unknown it is; and ensure everyone knows where their going. Make notes of
                                whether you can expect heavy weather and fog, will the nights be heavy lit and therefore maybe considerations for night vision may not be needed. In general: where your going, obstacles (creeks, roads), key terrain and
                                only describe ground relevant to the mission.Note whether we are against a completely hostile enemy and civilian populace, or will they're be a neutral go-between, are they alerted to our presence or not; and what kind
                                of regular activity should we expect, what should we suspect. Mention enemy strength, possible unit numbers and armaments, possible strong points and areas to avoid when describing the situation, make it clear and short,
                                summarizing and dot points are good for this.</p>
                            <p id="9.3">The mission line must be kept as simple as possible, effectively short and sweet, a good example would be: 1 Section is to clear TAOR Alpha NLT 1800h 11 June 2006, IOT allow A Coy to set up C.HQ</p>
                            <p id="9.4">Execution is best kept in dot points, and depending on mission, keep away from depth and general. Include brief synopsis of phase and what signifies the end of the phase. Remember the degrees of readiness (empty, load, action,
                                instant) and remember these do apply to ARMA 3. If we're in a non-hostile environment you shouldn't be walking around with your gun up; and remember empty signifies no magazine loaded, you still carry ammunition though.</p>
                            <p id="9.5">Describe the weapons and ammunition, and perhaps reference back to the enemy situation, if you may be facing a light armored vehicle patrol that's reported in the TAOR, then packing a anti-tank or ordnance may be a wise up.
                                Ensure everyone has their watches, and scouts and or section commanders carry there maps and radios; and any other essential equipment. Everyone should know their first - aid by now, but if its a bit unsure, run through
                                how to pull a team-mate out of the heat of battle and get him patched up.</p>
                            <p id="9.6">Note the location of the platoon headquarters, friendly command positions and where you can relax for some R+R, also note down any forward operation bases and out posts.</p>
                            <p id="9.7">Call signs should be recorded prior to action, and if possible their contents also, leaders should be decided between ranking members prior to action and depending on turnout, specific section positions designated.</p>
                            <p id="9.8">Communicate the intent clearly. Instead of giving instructions that are understandable, give instructions they can't misunderstand.</p>
